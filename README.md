`leveldown-hyper` is a fork of `leveldown` and uses [`HyperLevelDB`](https://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB) as backend. It extends the `leveldown` api with functionality to do live backups. This README only documents the `liveBackup()` method. For a complete reference we refer to [`leveldown`](https://github.com/Level/leveldown).

`leveldown` can be considered an upstream repository to `leveldown-hyper` and any common logic and bug fixes will be merged from upstream into this repository.

**If you are upgrading:** please see [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md).

### `db.liveBackup(name, callback)`

<code>liveBackup()</code> is an instance method on an existing database object, used to make a live backup of the current state of the database.

The `name` parameter is a `String`. A successful live backup will result in a backup folder named `backup-:name` inside the `location` folder of the current database.

The `callback` function will be called with no arguments when a live backup was successful, or with a single `error` argument if the backup operation failed for any reason.
